      <h2 class="bringing-together">Why a Supper Club?</h2>
        <div>Nothing brings people together like good food. And bringing people together is exactly what we intend to do.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="fighting-loneliness">Fighting the loneliness epidemic</h3>
      <div>At a time when we're simultaneously more connected yet lonelier and more isolated than ever, sharing a meal that you helped prepare with friends and strangers alike is a revolutionary act.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="overcoming-obstacles">Overcoming obstacles to community-building</h3>
      <div>Can you believe how expensive everything has gotten?! DSC members host dinner parties at their homes to make it easier to spend quality time without having to spend a lot of money.</div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="making-it-easier">Making it easier to meet new people</h3>
      <div>Whether you're trying to make new friends after graduating from college, moving to a new city, becoming a parent, finding your balance as an empty-nester, or anything else, DSC dinner parties make meeting new friends fun and accessible.</div>
