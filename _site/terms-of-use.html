    <p><em>Last updated:</em> December 8, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to the Decatur Supper Club! We’re a community-organized group of people who enjoy hosting and attending potluck-style dinner gatherings. We’re not a business, we don’t charge money, and we don’t operate as a legal entity. This website simply helps new people discover the club and lets interested folks sign up.</p>

<p>By using this website or signing up for the club, you agree to follow these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2 id="1-who-can-join">1. Who Can Join</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old to sign up.</p>

<p>You’re welcome to bring your children to events, as long as you supervise them.</p>

<h2 id="2-our-community-standards">2. Our Community Standards</h2>
<p>We want the club to feel safe, welcoming, and fun. So:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not discriminate based on age, race, religion, national origin or identity, culture, sexual orientation, gender identity, or anything else that makes you who you are.</li>
  <li>We also have a firm no fascists/no hate groups rule. Bigotry, harassment, threats, or hateful behavior aren’t tolerated.</li>
  <li>In short: don’t be a jerk and treat people the way they want to be treated.</li>
  <li>If someone violates these standards, we may remove them from the club or block access to events and communications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-what-this-website-does">3. What This Website Does</h2>
<p>The site includes a Sign Up button that links you to a Jotform form. When you fill it out, you’re sharing information with both Jotform and with us. Jotform is a secure, reputable platform for building forms to collect data, but if you have any questions or concerns about how your data is processed and stored through Jotform, refer to its <a href="https://www.jotform.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</p>

<p>We communicate with members only by email.</p>

<p>We may use other third-party tools from time to time (like event invitation tools or mailing list platforms), but only for normal club-related communication.</p>

<p>We don’t sell your personal data. Ever.</p>

<p>For details on how your data is handled, see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-your-responsibilities">4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>When you participate in the club or use this website, you agree to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide accurate information when signing up.</li>
  <li>Respect other members and hosts.</li>
  <li>Follow any reasonable guidelines set by event hosts (for example allergies, pet warnings, house rules, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-safety--personal-responsibility">5. Safety &amp; Personal Responsibility</h2>
<p>This is a volunteer-run community. Members host events in their homes at their own discretion. By attending any event, you agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You’re responsible for your own safety and belongings.</li>
  <li>You’ll use common sense when meeting people or going to someone’s home.</li>
  <li>Event hosts aren’t liable for accidents, injuries, or property loss.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re uncomfortable at an event or with another member, you can leave at any time and/or let the organizer know.</p>

<h2 id="6-accessibility">6. Accessibility</h2>
<p>We want our events and our online spaces to be as welcoming and accessible as possible. If you have an accessibility need — physical, sensory, dietary, or anything else — please let us know when you sign up or before an event. We can’t guarantee that every home or hosting space will meet every need, but hosts will do their best to accommodate requests when they can. If you ever feel excluded or unable to participate because of an accessibility issue, please reach out so we can improve.</p>

<h2 id="7-photo--media-policy">7. Photo &amp; Media Policy</h2>
<p>People often take photos at gatherings to share on social media. That’s totally fine, but please be considerate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask permission before posting photos that include other people.</li>
  <li>If a child appears in a photo, you must get express permission from their parent or guardian before sharing it online.</li>
  <li>If someone asks you not to photograph them or not to post a specific photo, please respect that.</li>
  <li>Event hosts may also set additional guidelines for their home.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want everyone to feel comfortable and respected when photos are being taken.</p>

<h2 id="8-changes-to-the-terms">8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms occasionally. If we make meaningful changes, we’ll post the new version on this page.</p>

<h2 id="9-contact">9. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns, email us at brown (dot) forrest (at) proton (dot) me.</p>
