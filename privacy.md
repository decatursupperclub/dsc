The Decatur Supper Club (“we,” “us,” “our”) is a community-organized, volunteer-run group. We don’t operate as a business, and we don’t sell anything. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.

We keep things simple and respectful — just like the club itself.

## 1. Information We Collect
When you sign up through our Buttondown form, we collect:
- Name
- Email address
- Food allergies or dietary restrictions
- Zip code
- Demographic information, like your age group (only what you choose to share)

We may also collect RSVP information for individual events.

We do not collect payment information, sensitive health data beyond dietary/allergy notes, or anything unrelated to the club.

## 2. How Your Information Is Stored
Your signup information is stored securely in Buttondown.

Host addresses and event details are never posted publicly. They’re only emailed to people who RSVP “yes” for a specific gathering.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use your information only for running the supper club and improving the experience for members. That includes:
- Sending event invitations and updates
- Keeping track of attendance
- Helping hosts plan meals that take allergies and dietary needs into account
- Understanding who’s joining our community so we can make the club welcoming and inclusive

Any demographic, age, or dietary information is used only for those purposes — never for marketing, profiling, or any commercial activity.

## 4. Who We Share Your Information With
Short answer: we don’t.

We never sell or share your personal information with advertisers, marketers, outside organizations, or anyone unrelated to the club.

The only third-party services involved are:
- Buttondown, which stores your signup information
- Apple Invites, which is currently what we use for event management

Both services have their own privacy policies, which govern how they handle data on their platforms.

## 5. Host Addresses & Event Locations
To protect everyone’s privacy and safety:
- Host home addresses are never posted on the website or social media.
- They’re only sent by email to people who’ve RSVP’d “yes” to a specific event.
- You must not forward or publicly share host addresses without explicit permission.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

You can contact us at any time to:
- Update your information
- Ask us to delete some or all of your information
- Unsubscribe from emails
- Leave the club entirely

We’ll honor your request as soon as we can.

## 7. Data Security
While no system is perfect, we take reasonable steps to keep your information safe:
- Using trusted tools (Buttondown, Apple Invites)
- Strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication
- Limiting access to club organizers only
- Keeping sensitive info (like host addresses) off public channels

## 8. Changes to This Policy
If we update this Privacy Policy, we’ll post the new version on this page. Significant changes will be noted clearly.

## 9. Contact
